*****NIKTO*****

$ man nikto
$ nikto -h

- Nikto no esta diseÃ±ado para ser sigilosa, ya que deja rastros de logs o en IPS/IDS, sin emabargo soporta metodos anti IDS de LibWhisker en caso se requeira evaluar un sistema IDS.

Web server vulnerability scanner
	-> Server and software misconfigs
	-> Default files and programs
	-> Insecure files and programs
	-> Outdated servers and programs

Options:

-Cgidirs -> Scan CGI directories "none" or "all" may be used to scan all CGI dirs. ...

(Common Gateway Interface: CGI is an interface specificatio for web servers to execute programs like console apps(cli programs) a CGI scrpit executes at the time a request is made and generates HTML. So an HTTP GET or POST request from the client may send HTML form data to the CGI program via standar input)


-config -> Specify an alternative confg file to use instead of the config.txt located in the install dir.

-dbcheck -> Check the sca databases for syntax erros.

-Display -> Control the output
	1 - Shows redirects
	2 - Shows coockies received
	3 - Show all 200/OK responses
	4 - Show URLs wich require auth
	D - Debug Output
	V - Verbose Output

-evasion -> Specify the LibWhsker encoding technique to use. ( see the LibWhisker docs).
	1 - Random URI enconding (non-UTF8)
	2 - Directory self-reference (/./)
	3 - Premature URL ending
	...
	8 - Use Windows directory separator (\)
	A - Use carriage return (0x0d) as a request spacer
	B - Use binary value 0x0b as a request spacer

-findonly -> Only discover HTTP(S) ports, do not perform a security scan

-Format -> Save the output -o (-output)
	csv - a comma-separated list
	htm - an HTML report
	txt - a text report
	xml - an XML report

-host -> Host(s) to target. Can be an IP add, hostname or text file of hosts. Can also parse nmap -oG style output.

-id -> ID and password for basic host auth "id:passwd".

-list-plugins -> Will list al plugins that Nikto can run against targets

-mutate -> Cause Nikto to combine test or attempt to guess values.
	1 - Test all files with all root dirs
	2 - Guess for passwd file names
	3 - Enumerate user names via Apache (/~user type requests)
	4 - Enumerate user names via cgiwrap
	5 - Attempt to brute force sub-domain names, assumens hostname is the parent domain
	6 - Attempt to guess directory names

-mutate-options -> Extra info for mutates

-nointeractive -> Disable interactv features

-nolookup -> Dont perform lookups on IP addrs.

-nossl -> Dont use SSL to connect to the server

-no404 -> Disable 404 checking

-ooutput -> Write output to the file specified

-plugins -> Select which pulgins will be run on the specified targets ( comma separated), ALL specifies all plugins shall be run and NON specifies no plugins shall be run. Default is ALL.

-port -> TCP ports to target.(i.e, 80-90) or (i.e 80,88,90). If not specified port 80 is used.

-Pause -> Seconds to delay between each test.

-root -> Prepend the value specified to the begining of every request. Is usefull to test apps or web servers which have all of their files under a certain dir.

-ssl -> Only test SSL on the ports specified. This will dramatically speed up request to HTTPS ports.

-Single -> Performa a single request to target server. Will promtp options to specify.

-timeout -> Seconds to wait before timing out a req (defaul 10 secs)

-Tuning -> Control the test that is run againts a target. (if used x will reverse tuning excluing the selected tests)
	0 - File upload
	1 - Interesting File / Seen in logs
	2 - Misconfg / Defualt file
	3 - Info disclosure
	4 - Injection (XSS/Script/HTML)
	5 - Remote file retriev
	6 - Denial of Service
	8 - Command Exec / Remote Shell
	9 - SQL injection
	a - Auth bypass
	b - Softwarte Identf
	c - Remote Source inclusion
	x - Reverse tunning

-useproxy -> Use the HTTP proxy defined in the config file

-update -> Update the plugins and databases directly from cirt.net

-vhost -> Scpecify the Host header to be sent to the target

*FILES*

nikto.conf -> parsed by order
	- /etc/nikto.conf
	- $HOME/nikto.conf
	- ./nickto.conf

${NIKTO_DIR}/plugins/db* -> db that nikto uses to check for vulns and issues.

${NIKTO_DIR}/plugins/*.plugin -> All niktos plugins


${NIKTO_DIR}/tempaltes -> templates for output formats
